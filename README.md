# hron

**Human-readable cron** — scheduling expressions that read like English and convert to and from cron.

```
every weekday at 9:00 except dec 25, jan 1 until 2027-12-31 in America/New_York
```

hron is a language specification with native implementations for multiple programming languages. It covers most of what cron expresses, and more that cron cannot: multi-week intervals, exception dates, end dates, and IANA timezone support with full DST awareness.

## Try It

**[hron.io](https://hron.io)** — interactive playground, no install needed.

```sh
cargo install hron-cli
```

```sh
$ hron "every weekday at 9:00 in America/New_York"
2026-02-09T09:00:00-05:00[America/New_York]

$ hron "every weekday at 9:00" -n 3
2026-02-09T09:00:00+00:00[UTC]
2026-02-10T09:00:00+00:00[UTC]
2026-02-11T09:00:00+00:00[UTC]

$ hron "every day at 9:00" --to-cron
0 9 * * *

$ hron --from-cron "*/30 * * * *"
every 30 min from 00:00 to 23:59

$ hron --explain "0 9 * * 1-5"
every weekday at 09:00
```

> **Note:** The JS/TS native package (`hron-ts`) uses the [Temporal API](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/) via polyfill. Once Temporal ships natively in runtimes, performance improves automatically. For performance-critical JS/TS use cases, consider the WASM package (`hron-wasm`).

## Library Usage

hron is available as a library in multiple languages:

```sh
# Rust
cargo add hron

# TypeScript / JavaScript
npm install hron-ts    # native
npm install hron-wasm  # WASM

# Dart / Flutter
dart pub add hron

# Python
pip install hron

# Go
go get github.com/simpllyf/hron/go/v2

# Java (Maven) — add io.hron:hron to pom.xml (see badge above for latest version)

# Kotlin (Gradle) — add io.hron:hron-kotlin to your dependencies (see badge above for latest version)

# C# / .NET
dotnet add package Hron

# Ruby
gem install hron
```

Swift needs no registry: SwiftPM resolves the repo's version tags. Add the package to `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/simpllyf/hron", from: "2.0.0"),
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "MyApp", dependencies: [.product(name: "Hron", package: "hron")]),
]
```

every 45 min from 09:00 to 17:00 on weekdays
```

### Weekly

```

every 3 weeks on mon, wed at 10:00
```

### Monthly

```
every month on the 1st at 9:00
every month on the 1st, 15th at 9:00
every month on the last day at 17:00
every month on the last weekday at 15:00

every month on the third thursday at 11:00
every month on the nearest weekday to 15th at 9:00
every month on the next nearest weekday to 1st at 9:00
every month on the previous nearest weekday to 31st at 17:00
```

### Yearly

```
every year on dec 25 at 00:00
every year on jul 4 at 12:00
every year on the first monday of march at 10:00
every year on the third thursday of november at 12:00
every year on the 15th of march at 09:00
every year on the last weekday of december at 17:00
every year on the last friday of december at 17:00
```

### One-off dates

```
on feb 14 at 9:00
on 2026-03-15 at 14:30
```

### Modifiers

Trailing clauses can be combined in this order: `except`, `until`, `starting`, `during`, `in`.

```
every weekday at 9:00 except dec 25, jan 1
every weekday at 9:00 except 2026-07-04
every day at 09:00 until 2026-12-31
every day at 09:00 until dec 31 starting 2026-01-01
every 2 weeks on monday at 9:00 starting 2026-01-05
every weekday at 9:00 in America/New_York
every day at 9:00 during jan, jun
every weekday at 9:00 except dec 25 until 2027-12-31 during jan, dec in UTC
```

- **`except`** — skip specific dates. Named dates (`dec 25`) recur every year. ISO dates (`2026-07-04`) are one-off.
- **`until`** — stop producing occurrences after this date. A named date (`dec 31`) has no year, so it needs `starting` and means the first such date on or after it.
- **`starting`** — first date that can fire; also the anchor for intervals (`every 3 days`, `every 2 weeks`). Required by a named `until`.
- **`during`** — only fire during specific months.
- **`in`** — `UTC` or an IANA `Area/Location` name, any case. Must be last.

## Cron Compatibility

hron converts to and from standard 5-field cron expressions exactly: the result fires at the same times on the same dates, or the conversion fails with an error that says why. This ignores the timezone and DST transitions, where cron schedulers differ.

| hron | cron |
|---|---|
| `every day at 9:00` | `0 9 * * *` |
| `every weekday at 9:00` | `0 9 * * 1-5` |
| `every weekend at 10:00` | `0 10 * * 0,6` |
| `every mon, wed, fri at 9:00` | `0 9 * * 1,3,5` |
| `every 30 min from 00:00 to 23:59` | `*/30 * * * *` |
| `every 15 min from 09:00 to 17:45 on weekday` | `*/15 9-17 * * 1-5` |
| `every month on the 1st at 9:00` | `0 9 1 * *` |
| `every month on the last friday at 16:00` | `0 16 * * 5L` |
| `every year on dec 25 at 00:00` | `0 0 25 12 *` |

`to_cron()` fails for:

- `except`, `until` and `starting`, which cron cannot bound;
- an ISO date, which does not repeat;
- a repeat every `n` days, weeks, months or years with `n > 1`, which cron cannot count;
- a directional nearest weekday (`next nearest`, `previous nearest`);
- a `during` that excludes a yearly or named date's month;
- times that are not every combination of their minutes and hours (`at 09:00, 17:30`, `every 45 min from 09:00 to 17:00`).

A schedule's timezone is not part of the cron: run the cron in the schedule's timezone.

`from_cron()` fails for crons that restrict both the day of month and the day of week (`0 9 15 * 1`), and for more than 24 times a day, unless they are evenly spaced on days an interval can carry (`*/7 * * * *` fires 216 times at uneven gaps). The [spec](spec/README.md#cron-conversion) has the full rules and every error message.

## Timezone & DST Behavior

When a schedule specifies a timezone via the `in` clause, all occurrences are computed in that timezone with full DST awareness:

- **Spring-forward (gap):** If a scheduled time doesn't exist (e.g. `2:30 AM` during a spring-forward transition), the occurrence shifts to the next valid time after the gap (typically `3:00 AM` or later, depending on the gap size).
- **Fall-back (ambiguity):** If a scheduled time is ambiguous (e.g. `1:30 AM` occurs twice during fall-back), the first (pre-transition) occurrence is used.
- **No timezone:** When no `in` clause is specified, UTC is used for deterministic, portable behavior.

All implementations (Rust, TypeScript, Dart, Python, Go, Java, C#, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, WASM) follow these same DST semantics.

The [conformance test suite](spec/tests.json) includes explicit spring-forward and fall-back test cases to verify this behavior across all implementations.

## Conformance Spec

The [spec/](spec/) directory contains the language-agnostic conformance test suite (`tests.json`) and formal grammar (`grammar.ebnf`). The grammar is a reference specification — all parsers are hand-written [recursive descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser), not generated from the EBNF. All language implementations must pass the conformance tests.
